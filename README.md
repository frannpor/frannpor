- Building RESTful APIs using Node.js and Express for backend development.
- Utilizing databases, including MongoDB and PostgreSQL, to efficiently store and manage information in applications.
- Implementing modern and stylized interfaces using tools like Tailwind CSS.

## Additional Methodologies and Tools

In addition to my technical skills, I also have experience with agile methodologies such as Scrum for effective project management in a team environment. I have used tools like Trello for task organization and tracking.
